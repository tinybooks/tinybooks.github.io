<p>The simplest ideas are often the best and <a href="https://gutentagmethod.com" title="GutenTag">GutenTag</a> is so simple you’ll wonder it never occurred to you. As Mark Newton, its designer, puts it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No more complex agendas, journals, apps… GutenTag is an elegant offline solution for planning your day. Stamp it, draw it, do it. Perfect for those of us who are visual learners, creatives, and the rest of the world that is overwhelmed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know about you, but I’m often overwhelmed. I always carry multiple scratch notebooks (one per current project) and one of these is focused on my daily to-do list. GutenTag fits this system perfectly. By
compartmentalising the day using GutenTag I can visually plan my day and, as Newton states, “Stamp out procrastination!”</p>

<p>487% funded on Kickstarter in 30 Days, I’m clearly not alone in appreciating GutenTag’s elegant approach. If you’re forever frustrated by time, it might just be what you’ve been looking for.</p>
