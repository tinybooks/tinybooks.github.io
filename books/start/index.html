    <h2>Would you like to launch a business?</h2>

    <p>Have you ever dreamed of running a business? Have you ever imagined a future where your business aligns with your passions? Have you ever had an idea, but never quite managed to get it off the ground and turn it into a reality?</p>

    <p>I've been there and done it many times and, as an educator, I love helping others achieve success through the creation of sustainable and profitable businesses.</p>

    <p>In this practical book, I'll help you get started so that you can turn your idea into a reality, building a profitable business.</p>

    <h2>Start!</h2>

    <p>My first Tiny Book underlines the importance of pursuing your passion. I start by suggesting ways to identify that passion (how do you recognise it?) before stressing the need to pursue that passion and make it real.</p>

    <p>With only 86,400 seconds a day (all of them non-refundable), I emphasise the need to put every second to good use. I explore the importance of identifying core values and putting these at the heart of the business, before providing a set of tried and tested strategies to turn your idea into a reality.</p>

    <h3>What's in the book?</h3>

    <ol class="list-chapters">
      <li>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>Why has there never been a better time to start? What about now is different? Here are concrete facts – about enablers that change the way we can do business now, powered by the web – that underpin my belief that now is the time to start.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Chapter 1 · It Starts With You</h4>
        <p>Find your passion. Find the spark you can use to start. Put everything behind your passion and turn it into a reality. Look deep inside and identify your inner purpose. Do that and you’ll have a stronger foundation on which to build a product with meaning.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Chapter 2 · What’s your story?</h4>
        <p>It’s important to identify your core values and, by extension, your story. Business is changing in this new century (and new millennium), and even with just fifteen years’ perspective, new ways are emerging to build businesses that are purpose-driven and built on core values.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Chapter 3 · Designing Your Future</h4>
        <p>Steal like an artist. Seek inspiration from others and gather just enough influences to give you a clear sense of direction. Define a goal using envisioning techniques, and map a path towards that goal, breaking it down into distinct deliverables.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Case Studies</h4>
        <p>
        Start! features three case studies you can draw inspiration from: Hiut Denim; Kano; and Sugru. All have lessons we can learn from: about the power of focus; about the importance of stories; and about the importance of persistence, and never giving up.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Chapter 7  ·  Turn Your Idea Into a Reality</h4>
        <p>In this final chapter I tie together everything that’s covered in the book. It’s about the importance of execution and how – although initially daunting – any complex task can be broken down into discrete and manageable elements.</p>
