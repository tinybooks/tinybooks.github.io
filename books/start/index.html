    <p>Our first Tiny Book underlines the importance of pursuing your passion. I start by suggesting ways to identify that passion (how do you recognise it?) before stressing the need to pursue that passion and make it real.</p>
    <p>With only 86,400 seconds a day (all of them non-refundable), I emphasise the need to put every second to good use. I explore the importance of identifying core values and putting these at the heart of the business, before providing a set of tried and tested strategies</p>

    <h3>What's in the book?</h3>

    <ol class="list-chapters">
      <li>
        <h4>Chapter 1 · It Starts With You</h4>
        <p>Find your passion. Find the spark you can use to start. Put everything behind your passion and turn it into a reality. Look deep inside and identify your inner purpose. Do that and you’ll have a stronger product, a product underpinned by purpose and built on meaning. These are strong foundations on which to build.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Chapter 2 · What’s your story?</h4>
        <p>It’s important to identify your core values and, by extension, your story. Business is changing in this new century (and new millennium), and even with just fifteen years’ perspective, new ways are emerging to build businesses that are purpose-driven and based on core values.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Chapter 3 · Designing Your Future</h4>
        <p>Define your product DNA. Steal like an artist. Be inspired by others and find just enough DNA to give you a clear sense of direction; a DNA mix that affords enough inspiration to identify your own path. Define a goal using envisioning techniques, and map a path towards that goal, breaking it down into discrete deliverables.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Chapter 4 · Case Study: Hiut Denim</h4>
        <p>An ‘ideas company’ that just happens to manufacture beautifully tailored jeans, Hiut Denim is focused on, as its co-founder David Hieatt puts it, “Doing one thing well.”</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Chapter 5 · Case Study: Kano</h4>
        <p>Kano is more than a computing company, it’s really a platform that encourages its owners to explore and to find out how the world of computing works. It's a business built on stories.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Chapter 6 · Case Study: Sugru</h4>
        <p>An overnight success that took over a decade to build, Sugru’s mission is summarised neatly with its goal to ‘fix (or improve) the world’. Its story is one of the power of persistence.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Chapter 7 · Turn Your Idea Into a Reality</h4>
        <p>Here we tie together everything that’s covered in the book. It’s about the importance of execution and how, although daunting, any complex task can be broken down into discrete and manageable elements.</p>
