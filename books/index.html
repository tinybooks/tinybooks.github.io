	<h2>The Tiny Books Universe</h2>

	<p>The <em>Tiny Books</em> universe combines content of varying lengths, which is designed to fit together. <em>Planets</em> are longer books exploring core topics in-depth. <em>Moons</em> are shorter, supplementary books. <em>Comets</em> are delivered, free, via a monthly newsletter. And <em>Stars</em>, posts at the <em>Tiny Books</em> web site, illustrate design and business thinking in a timely manner.</p>

	<p>Collectively this content grows to build a library that covers everything today’s creative needs to know and understand to turn an idea for a creative business into a commercial reality.</p>

	<h3>Planets</h3>

	<ul class="list-books">
	<li><cite><strong>Start!</strong> Why Pursuing Your Passion is Everything</cite></li>
	<li><cite><strong>Talkaboutability</strong> Great Brands Are Storytellers</cite></li>
	<li><cite><strong>Ka-Ching!</strong> Navigating the Tricky Topic of Pricing</cite></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Moons</h3>

	<ul class="list-books">
	<li><cite><strong>You Are a Channel</strong> Build Your Business by Nurturing Your 1,000 True Fans</cite></li>
	<li><cite><strong>Idea Factories</strong> Where do great ideas come from?</cite></li>
	<li><cite><strong>Every Tiny Collision</strong> Why Touchpoints Matter to Your Brand</cite></li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Learn From Real World Case Studies</h2>

	<p>One of the things I’m focusing on with <em>Tiny Books</em> is taking the intersection of design and business theory, and showing its application in the real world. As such, it’s important that each of the books feature real life case studies. I’m fortunate, through conference speaking, to have the opportunity to meet a lot of incredibly talented people doing remarkable work. These people will all form the backbone of my case studies.</p>

	<p>My first in-depth book, <cite>Start!</cite>, features three case studies: Hiut Denim, Sugru and Kano. My first micro-book <cite>You Are a Channel</cite> features one case study: Slack. Other case studies I plan to feature, include: AIAIAI, Brewbot, Dribbble, GOV.UK, Lagom, Offscreen, Pinboard, Tattly… and many, many more.</p>

	<p>In short, there are a wealth of companies I believe readers can learn from, companies that are collectively pursuing new models of business and taking their talents to the web. Highlighting these companies’ best practice inspires readers and gives them the confidence to succeed, echoing <em>Tiny Books’</em> purpose.</p>
