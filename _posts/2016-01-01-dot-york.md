I’m delighted to be speaking at [DotYork][01] on 8 June, 2016 (in York). DotYork is, “a digital conference for curious minds,” and I’ll be leading an ‘episode’ on the theme of [Continuous Learning][02], with a panel of others focused on learning.

I’ll be exploring the need to set aside time for personal development in our fast-paced and ever-changing industry.

I’m looking forward to sharing a few practical lessons I’ve learned that enable lifelong learning, not least helping you find the elusive time you need to ensure you’re learning’s constant and you’re forever ahead of the curve.

[Tickets are on sale now.][03] If you’re in York in June I’d love to see you there.
