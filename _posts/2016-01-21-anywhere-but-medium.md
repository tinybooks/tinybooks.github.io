As Dave Winer puts it, in [Anywhere but Medium][01]:

> [The] next time you want to post an essay to Medium, do the open web a favour and post it elsewhere.

> Anywhere.

Call me old-fashioned, but I love Weiner’s curmudgeonly tone, and I wholeheartedly agree with his thinking. As he puts it:

> Medium is on its way to becoming the consensus platform for writing on the web. If you’re not sure you’re going to be blogging regularly, the default place to put your writing is Medium.

The trouble with this approach lies in the fact that, if you’re not careful, you’re driving traffic to Medium (which has its own priorities in play), when perhaps you should be driving that traffic to your own home on the web.

The web is about destinations, underpinned by hyperlinks. Medium has it’s benefits, of course, but nothing beats hosting your own thoughts (essays, if you will) at your own site.
