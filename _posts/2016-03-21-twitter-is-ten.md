Twitter celebrated its tenth birthday today. It’s been a tumultuous ten years, shaping a global, real-time conversation, but there’s no doubting the service’s impact on the world of communication.

As the team put it:

> Throughout the years, you’ve made Twitter what it is today and you’re shaping what it will be in the future. Thank you for making history, driving change, lifting each other up and laughing together every day.

As it embarks on the next – admittedly uncertain – phase of its journey, I, for one, hope it rediscovers the energy and excitement that attracted me to it a decade ago. [Happy Birthday, Twitter!][01]
