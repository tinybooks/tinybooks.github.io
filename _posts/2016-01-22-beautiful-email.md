We might all be struggling to reach [Inbox Zero][01], but that doesn’t mean email as a way to share you stories isn’t effective. The key to standing out in a crowded inbox is to put a little effort in and ensure your email is beautiful.

Ever-helpful, the folks at Campaign Monitor have put together a case study showcasing FontShop’s wonderful work in this medium. As they put it:

> Some emails look more like works of art than marketing assets.

Looking at FontShop’s lovingly designed emails, I’m sure you’d agree.

You might not be a typography aficionado, but I’m sure you’ll appreciate the lengths the FontShop team go to, to ensure that their emails stand out in your overflowing inbox.

[How Fontshop Uses Design to Bring Beauty to Email Marketing][02] is worth reading to gain an insight into how the FontShop team position design at the heart of their email marketing efforts. If nothing else, you might pick up a typographic tip or two along the way. (Which – I hope you’ll agree – is no bad thing.)
