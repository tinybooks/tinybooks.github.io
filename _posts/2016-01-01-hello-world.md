It's been a time-honoured tradition of mine to launch any new journal with a short 'Hello, World!' post. Given that the Tiny Books site is built using GitHub Pages and Jekyll, it seemed appropriate to link to the 'Hello, World!' page at GitHub Guides to get the ball rolling.

[Hello, World!][01]

Tradition, once again, upheld.
