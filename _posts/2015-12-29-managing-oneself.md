Peter Drucker's [Managing Oneself][01] is a perennial favourite that I return to year after year.

It's short, to the point and can be read in a couple of hours. The advice it contains, however, will reverberate long afterwards. Drucker is the author of numerous books, all well worth reading, this short book…

It’s a short book, but I’ve found it useful. In the earlier part of the book, where it focuses on manners, there’s lots of good content that I stress that to my students. This part:

> Manners are the lubricating oil of an organisation. … Manners — simple things like saying ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ and knowing a person’s name or asking after her family — enable two people to work together whether they like each other or not. Bright people, especially bright young people, often do not understand this.
> If analysis shows that someone’s brilliant work fails again and again as soon as cooperation from others is required, it probably indicates a lack of courtesy — that is, a lack of manners.

It was the latter part of the book, on the second half of a career, that I thought useful in this case. The review continues here.

More content. Take a look at: 1. Farnham Street; 2. A Working Library; 3. My past reviews for magazines… (8 Faces, etc.) to get a feel for length, etc..
