If 3D printing’s caught your eye, but you’ve been put off by the (still) exorbitant price of entry, Mattel’s new [ThingMaker][01] might just be the device that enables you to dip your toe in the water of 3D printing, enabling you to explore its potential.

At $300, it’s relatively affordable, and it comes with software courtesy of AutoDesk, which promises ease of use, thanks to a well-designed hardware and software ecosystem.

As the price of technology continues to plummet, the ThingMaker looks like an interesting new entry point into the world of 3D printing, perhaps signalling the beginnings of more pervasive use of the technology.

As WIRED put it: [“ThingMaker is for kids, but you’ll want this 3D printer for yourself.”][02]
