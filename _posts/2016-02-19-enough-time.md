Andrea Tsurumi on managing the demands upon your time as a freelancer (and a workaholic):

> As a freelancer and a workaholic, it’s hard to know how to set my own boundaries, because the work could just never end … and that’s definitely not good for my art and certainly not good for my health, so I’ve become better about being firm about my time.

Tsurumi’s client list is impressive, including The New York Times and Penguin Books, yet she still finds time for personal projects, teaching and speaking engagements.

As she points out, you’ll never have enough time, so it’s all the more important to manage that time wisely, focusing on what really matters.
