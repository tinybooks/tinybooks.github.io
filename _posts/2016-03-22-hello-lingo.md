If you work with photographs, illustrations, icons (or anything visual),  [Lingo][01] looks well worth a look. Developed by the folks behind The Noun Project it promises to be, “the best way to organise, share and use all your visual assets in one place.”

Available on both free and paid plans, it looks like an useful way of managing your visual assets. As the Lingo folks put it: “Files hide in folders, visuals live in Lingo.”
