Paul Jarvis bids farewell to Medium. As he puts it, [It’s not you, it’s me.][01] Jarvis states:

> I’ve realised that I don’t want to keep playing in other people’s playgrounds. I’d rather focus on and foster my own.

> While you’ve helped me grow my audience (I have more followers here than on Twitter or my own mailing list), growth isn’t my only metric for measuring what I do and how much it supports me.

Jarvis is just one in a series of writers that, as we ease into a new year, are revisiting the platforms that they embrace (or eschew), rediscovering the spirit of the open web and focusing their efforts on their own plots. ([Homesteading, not sharecropping.][02])

Yes, Medium has benefits, and – as Jarvis acknowledges - Medium has helped him grow his audience, however, the quid pro quo is that Jarvis is driving (his) traffic elsewhere. There’s always a trade off.

It’s interesting how many writers (and content gatherers) are following suit. There’s clearly something in the air, and that something is a desire to retake ownership of content, removing it from walled gardens and returning it to the open web.
