If you’ve ever heard Aaron Draplin speak you’ll know that when he announces a retrospective book of his work contains [Pretty Much Everything][01], it contains… pretty much everything (and I can assure you that’s a pretty much everything you’ll eagerly want to explore).

Draplin is an incredibly entertaining communicator. I had the pleasure of organising a venue for him, in 2012, when he spoke in Belfast as a part of [Build][02]. (I also enjoyed a late night liason with him in our local McDonalds – sorry – when I bumped into him after hours… we were both famished.)

He’s an inspiring, and entertainingly forthright speaker, with American sized portions of advice to share. I’m very much looking forward to his book.
