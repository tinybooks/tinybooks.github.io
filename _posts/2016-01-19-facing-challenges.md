It’s no secret that I’m a [Sugru][01] supporter. (Sugru is, perhaps unsurprisingly, a case study in my first Tiny Book [Start!][02])

I’ve always found Sugru’s story inspiring. It’s a story of relentless  – never-give-up – perseverance. It’s also a story that we can all learn from, about the power of staying true to your vision and pursuing that vision to the end.

In 2014, when I launched my Kickstarter for my design conference, [Break][03], Sugru founder Jane Ni Dhulchaointigh – I prefer to call her ‘Jane’, as I’ve always struggled with accurate pronunciations – was right at the heart of my speaker wishlist.

I was delighted when she agreed to speak at Break, and her talk – on the highs and lows of her journey – had attendees talking for quite some time afterwards. (It’s no exaggeration to say that she completely moved the audience.)

I was delighted to see that the fine folks at moo.com have an interview with Jane, [‘on innovation and facing challenges’][04]. (I’ll admit, I was late finding it.)

I’d wholeheartedly recommend reading Jane’s story. If you’ve ever had a dream, but found the confidence knocked out of you along your journey, Jane has a lot to share with you. As she puts it:

> Start small and make it good.

I think that’s great advice. Start small. Make something. Make it the best you can. After that the pieces – generally – fall into place.
