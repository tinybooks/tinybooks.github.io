Jordan Koschei interviews Ludwig Pettersson, Creative Director at Stripe, for Medium’s ‘In Progress’. There’s a lot to learn in [Koschei’s interview][01], but one aspect caught my eye in particular, Pettersson’s assertion that:

> There should be nothing standing in the way of starting a business or selling something online and charging for it.

This idea – of levelling the playing field and allowing anyone with an idea for a business to compete with others – lies at the heart of Stripe and other services like it.

Many years ago, when I ran a [record label][02], managing payments was an expensive business, requiring credit card terminals with costly terms and conditions. Stripe does away with this complexity and, in so doing, paves the way for a host of new, fleet-of-foot businesses to take root.
