Say, “Hello!” to [Operator][01], a new monospace typeface (and accompanying monospace-inspired typeface) courtesy of Hoefler & Co.

Designed by Andy Clymer, Operator draws its inspiration from the world of fixed-width fonts whilst eschewing, “the many compromises required of a fixed-width design.”

It’s a lovely typeface – as you’d expect from Hoefler & Co. – and is ideally suited to code environments.
