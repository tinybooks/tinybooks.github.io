I always enjoy Armin Vit and Bryony Gomez-Palacio’s posts at [Under Consideration][01]. Collectively they cast a critical eye on the wonderful world of graphic design and branding, thoughtfully analysing the identities that cross their paths. BANANAS!

Vit’s analysis of the new brand for [VCSO][02] is typically exhaustive (exhaustive in a good way) exploring the rationale behind VCSO’s move towards a new, more simplified, marque.

Though VCSO’s marque might appear simple, there’s a great deal of thought behind it, and – while outwardly distilled – if you dig a little deeper there’s a great deal of thought in play.

I’d strongly recommend reading Vit’s analysis, you’ll learn a great deal about how brands work if you do so. At the end of the day, your brand can be distilled down to its essence (in this case a series of circles), what’s important is that you understand what that essence is.
