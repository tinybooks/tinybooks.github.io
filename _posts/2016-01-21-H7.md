I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t tempted by B&O Play’s [Beoplay H7][01] Cenere Grey headphones: “Premium wireless over-ear headphone with authentic, clear sound performance.” At £329 they’re a little beyond my budget, but that doesn’t mean I can’t aspire.

I had to look up ‘Cenere Grey’. As a designer, with over two decades of experience, it’s not a colour I’d heard of before, but a quick search and I found a multitude of other products available in this – not quite grey – of greys.

(It turns out you can get a Vespa in Cenere Grey, too.)

B&O Play talk about ‘touches of magic’ when they describe the product. What struck me was the use of language as a core part of the product’s description. I can see myself now, trying to persuade Cara – my wife – that these aren’t just headphones, they’re ‘Cenere Grey’ headphones.

I doubt that will fly, but still… one can hope.
