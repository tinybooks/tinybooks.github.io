If you’re dipping your toe into the world of self-publishing (which, clearly, I’m dipping my toe into) you might like to read The Bookseller’s [How big is self-publishing?][01] Whilst the figures are varied – and due to issues of confidentiality – limited, there’s a considerable amount of insight to be gained if you’re considering a self-published book.

tl;dr? The opportunities are there if you choose to grasp them.
