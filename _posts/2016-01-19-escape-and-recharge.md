If you haven’t discovered [Lagom][01], I’d encourage you to rectify that now. Lovingly produced by Elliot and Samantha Stocks, it should occupy pride of place on coffee tables the world over (after having been read, of course).

I was delighted to be invited to contribute an article on wild swimming for Issue 3, for the magazine’s [Escape and Recharge][02] section.

I believe it’s important to have a space away from the clamour of our ever-present, digitally-accelerated lives – and, for me, that space away is wild swimming – so the article was a welcome opportunity to share that belief, for a need for non-digital space, with others.

Beautifully photographed by [Dan Rubin][03] – who captured the wilds of the rugged Donegal coastline perfectly – I was delighted with the final result.

Issue 3, like Issues 1 and 2, is a beauty and is [available now][04].
