WIRED revisits the year in branding through a dozen designs. I particularly liked Coca-Cola’s [no-logo logo][01] by FP7/DXB, McCann-Erickson’s agency branch in Dubai, created as a limited-edition run.

Sold in Middle Eastern countries for the month of Ramadan, as part of Coca-Cola’s ongoing world peace-themed campaign, it’s instantly recognisable sans script. Lovely.
