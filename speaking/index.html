	<h2>Speaking and Workshops</h2>

	<p>I’m a passionate speaker and have spoken at events, large and small, all over the world. I’ve delivered keynotes, opened and closed conferences, and run workshops on a wide variety of topics. I’m known for my entertaining style, which is educational, but – equally importantly – enjoyable.</p>

	<p>In addition to speaking at Build, Smashing Conference, Industry and numerous other conferences, I’ve also worked with private clients, including Booking.com and the BBC, to deliver bespoke presentations and workshops.</p>
	
	<p>I have over two decades of speaking experience. I’m able to customise my content to suit your audience, be it large or small, and I’d be happy to explore potential topics with you. I’ve provided a comprehensive list of my speaking and workshops below.</p>
	
	<p>If you’re running a conference, I’d love to work with you. <a href="mailto:chris@monographic.org?subject=Hello!" title="Please do get in touch.">Get in touch.</a></p>
