	<h1>Tiny Books</h1>
	<p>Welcome to <em>Tiny Books:</em> short, sharp books for creative entrepreneurs that explore the design of business and the business of design.</p>
	<p>Brief books, which tackle timeless topics, <em>Tiny Books</em> cover content that inhabits the twin galaxies of design and business. If you’re involved in the worlds where these disciplines overlap, I think you’ll love <em>Tiny Books</em>.</p>
	<p><em>Tiny Books</em> are intended for digital pioneers: creatives taking their talents to the rapidly proliferating digital landscape and harnessing the opportunities it affords. <em>Tiny Books</em> explore both theory and practice, applying theory through focused, downloadable worksheets. They are intended for what David Hieatt calls <a href="http://thedobook.co/products/the-path-of-the-doer">doers</a> (individuals who ‘do’ rather than ‘talk’).</p>
	<p>Over time, <em>Tiny Books</em> will grow into a library for doers, covering everything you need to know to turn your creative idea into a commercial reality.</p>

	<h2>Tiny Books Are Tried and Tested</h2>
	<p>I’ve drawn the content for <em>Tiny Books</em> from over a decade of working with creative businesses of all sizes. The material is tried and tested, through a combination of: consultancy, working with startups in the creative industries; teaching, particularly through content I deliver on my MFA Multidisciplinary Design programme, a startup-focused Masters at the Belfast School of Art; and, finally, through content I delivered as a lead trainer on a number of creative startup programmes pioneered by <a href="http://www.nesta.org.uk">Nesta</a>.</p>
	<p>Through this work, I’ve mentored a generation of designers, helping them develop the critical business skills required to succeed and thrive. Don’t take my word for it, however. Here’s what a handful of the people I’ve worked with say:</p>

	<h2>The Tiny Books Universe</h2>

	<p>The <em>Tiny Books</em> universe combines content of varying lengths, which is designed to fit together. <em>Planets</em> are longer books exploring core topics in-depth. <em>Moons</em> are shorter, supplementary books. <em>Comets</em> are delivered, free, via a monthly newsletter. And <em>Stars</em>, posts at the <em>Tiny Books</em> web site, illustrate design and business thinking in a timely manner.</p>

	<p>Collectively this content grows to build a library that covers everything today’s creative needs to know and understand to turn an idea for a creative business into a commercial reality.</p>

	<h3>Planets</h3>

	<ul class="list-books">
	<li><cite><strong>Start!</strong> Why Pursuing Your Passion is Everything</cite></li>
	<li><cite><strong>Talkaboutability</strong> Great Brands Are Storytellers</cite></li>
	<li><cite><strong>Ka-Ching!</strong> Navigating the Tricky Topic of Pricing</cite></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Moons</h3>

	<ul class="list-books">
	<li><cite><strong>You Are a Channel</strong> Build Your Business by Nurturing Your 1,000 True Fans</cite></li>
	<li><cite><strong>Idea Factories</strong> Where do great ideas come from?</cite></li>
	<li><cite><strong>Every Tiny Collision</strong> Why Touchpoints Matter to Your Brand</cite></li>

	<h2>Learn From Real World Case Studies</h2>

	<p>One of the things I’m focusing on with <em>Tiny Books</em> is taking the intersection of design and business theory, and showing its application in the real world. As such, it’s important that each of the books feature real life case studies. I’m fortunate, through conference speaking, to have the opportunity to meet a lot of incredibly talented people doing remarkable work. These people will all form the backbone of my case studies.</p>

	<p>My first in-depth book, <cite>Start!</cite>, features three case studies: Hiut Denim, Sugru and Kano. My first micro-book <cite>You Are a Channel</cite> features one case study: Slack. Other case studies I plan to feature, include: AIAIAI, Brewbot, Dribbble, GOV.UK, Lagom, Offscreen, Pinboard, Tattly… and many, many more.</p>

	<p>In short, there are a wealth of companies I believe readers can learn from, companies that are collectively pursuing new models of business and taking their talents to the web. Highlighting these companies’ best practice inspires readers and gives them the confidence to succeed, echoing <em>Tiny Books’</em> purpose.</p>
