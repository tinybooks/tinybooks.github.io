#Projecting Confidence

As psychologist Amy Cuddy puts it in her book, [Presence][01]:

> Too often we approach our lives' biggest hurdles with dread, execute them with anxiety, and leave them with regret.

I'm sure all but the most confident of us can identify with this assertion (and I'd question even those 'most confident' that categorically deny this ever-present anxiety touches upon them). How we present ourselves affects how others see us, but – arguably more importantly - changes how we see ourselves.

Cuddy's first TED talk – [Your Body Language Shapes Who You Are][02] – on body language and how it influences our interactions with others has been viewed over 30,000,000 times. I'd strongly recommend a short twenty minute detour to watch it, it's filled with valuable advice.

Cuddy's etc., etc., etc..

Mention the 'power pose' and then quote some of Cuddy's thoughts on that, in particular this line:

> It’s not about the content of the speech. It’s about the presence that they’re bringing to the speech.

Everything you ever wanted to know about 'high-power poses' and 'low-power poses' 


Science.
