[Escape and Recharge](http://blog.readlagom.com/post/137623698253/the-emptiness-of-the-sea-allows-you-space-to)

If you haven't discovered Lagom, I'd encourage you to rectify that now. Lovingly produced by Elliot and Samantha Jay Stocks, it should occupy pride of place on coffee tables the world over (after having been read, of course).

I was delighted to be invited to contribute an article on wild swimming for Issue 3, for the magazine's Escape and Recharge section.

I believe it's important to have a space away from the clamour of our ever-present, digitally-accelerated lives so the article was a welcome opportunity to share that belief with others.

Beautifully photographed by the immensely talented (and very lovely) Dan Rubinâ€¦ Something about the rugged Donegal coastline perfectly.

Issue 3, like Issues 1 and 2, is a beauty and is [available now][].
