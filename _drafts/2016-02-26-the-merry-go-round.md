It's impossible to maintain momentum on a single task for a sustained period of time without wearing yourself out. Understanding this means you can develop strategies for completing tasks by breaking them down into smaller, achievable tasks.

Every task, no matter how seemingly simple, is made up of other, smaller tasks. The secret to getting things done is to identify these tasks and build a plan of action around them. That way, when you tire of one task, you can move on to other, related tasks.

I called this strategy 'The Merry-Go-Round'.

When you find your energy flagging while struggling to complete a particular task at hand it might be an idea to move onto another task in your task chain. Doing so, provides you with a fresh set of challenges, and provides a welcome break (whilst, crucially, still maintaining forward momentum).

Of course, you can use this approach to chain together unrelated projects, maintaining a flow across several projects simultaneously.

Next time you find your energies depleted and your forward momentum slowing, consider moving sideways and giving yourself a welcome shot of energy as you kick off the next item on your list of things to do.
