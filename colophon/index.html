	<h1>Tiny Books</h1>
	<p>Welcome to <em>Tiny Books:</em> short, sharp books for creative entrepreneurs that explore the design of business and the business of design.</p>
	<p>Brief books, which tackle timeless topics, <em>Tiny Books</em> cover content that inhabits the twin galaxies of design and business. If you’re involved in the worlds where these disciplines overlap, I think you’ll love <em>Tiny Books</em>.</p>
	<p><em>Tiny Books</em> are intended for digital pioneers: creatives taking their talents to the rapidly proliferating digital landscape and harnessing the opportunities it affords. <em>Tiny Books</em> explore both theory and practice, applying theory through focused, downloadable worksheets. They are intended for what David Hieatt calls <a href="http://thedobook.co/products/the-path-of-the-doer">doers</a> (individuals who ‘do’ rather than ‘talk’).</p>
	<p>Over time, <em>Tiny Books</em> will grow into a library for doers, covering everything you need to know to turn your creative idea into a commercial reality.</p>

	<p>Through this work, I’ve mentored a generation of designers, helping them develop the critical business skills required to succeed and thrive. Don’t take my word for it, however. Here’s what a handful of the people I’ve worked with say:</p>
