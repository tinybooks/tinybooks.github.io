      <p>If you work with photographs, illustrations, icons (or anything visual),  <a href="https://www.lingoapp.com" title="Lingo by The Noun Project">Lingo</a> looks well worth a look. Developed by the folks behind The Noun Project it promises to be, “the best way to organise, share and use all your visual assets in one place.”</p>

<p>Available on both free and paid plans, it looks like a useful way of managing your visual assets. As the Lingo folks put it: “Files hide in folders, visuals live in Lingo.”</p>

      <p>Twitter celebrated its tenth birthday today. It’s been a tumultuous ten years, shaping a global, real-time conversation, but there’s no doubting the service’s impact on the world of communication.</p>

<p>As the team put it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Throughout the years, you’ve made Twitter what it is today and you’re shaping what it will be in the future. Thank you for making history, driving change, lifting each other up and laughing together every day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As it embarks on the next – admittedly uncertain – phase of its journey, I, for one, hope it rediscovers the energy and excitement that attracted me to it a decade ago. <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2016/thank-you-love-twitter" title="Thank you! Love, Twitter.">Happy Birthday, Twitter!</a></p>

      <p>If 3D printing’s caught your eye, but you’ve been put off by the (still) exorbitant price of entry, Mattel’s new <a href="http://thingmaker.com" title="Welcome to ThingMaker 3D Studios">ThingMaker</a> might just be the device that enables you to dip your toe in the water of 3D printing, enabling you to explore its potential.</p>

<p>At $300, it’s relatively affordable, and it comes with software courtesy of AutoDesk, which promises ease of use, thanks to a well-designed hardware and software ecosystem.</p>

<p>As the price of technology continues to plummet, the ThingMaker looks like an interesting new entry point into the world of 3D printing, perhaps signalling the beginnings of more pervasive use of the technology.</p>

<p>As WIRED put it: <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/02/thingmaker-is-for-kids-but-youll-want-this-3-d-printer-for-yourself/" title="ThingMaker is for kids, but you’ll want this 3D printer for yourself.">“ThingMaker is for kids, but you’ll want this 3D printer for yourself.”</a></p>

      <p>Andrea Tsurumi on managing the demands upon your time as a freelancer (and a workaholic):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a freelancer and a workaholic, it’s hard to know how to set my own boundaries, because the work could just never end … and that’s definitely not good for my art and certainly not good for my health, so I’ve become better about being firm about my time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tsurumi’s client list is impressive, including The New York Times and Penguin Books, yet she still finds time for personal projects, teaching and speaking engagements.</p>

<p>As she points out, you’ll never have enough time, so it’s all the more important to manage that time wisely, focusing on what really matters.</p>

      <p>As creatives, we’re often guilty of spending so much time creating a master plan in our heads that we never actually get around to realising that master plan and getting it off the ground.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever lain awake at night putting together the pieces of a grand strategy for world domination (but never actually implemented that strategy) you might be suffering from ‘idea debt’.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://observer.com/2016/02/imagining-your-future-projects-is-holding-you-back/" title="Idea Debt">Imagining Your Future Projects Is Holding You Back</a>, Jessica Abel argues that the struggle with ‘creative sunk costs’ – the oceans of time we often invest in planning everything down to the last detail – often holds you back from actually realising anything.</p>

<p>I can relate to this completely. I spent two years (an ocean of time, indeed) planning Tiny Books. I spent so much time thinking through every detail that I forgot the most important detail… to actually finish a book. I’m sure you can relate to this too.</p>

<p>Abel quotes Kazu Kibushi, who states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I try not to to look at what I’m going to do as this [grand vision]. I’m not just fulfilling some old promise that I made a long time ago. Now I’m actually solving problems in the moment, and that’s so much more exciting than than trying to fill years of what I call my ‘idea debt’.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The truth is, no matter what you do, it will never be as great as it is in your mind, and so you’re really setting yourself up for failure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Abel’s article is well worth reading and – if you recognise the tell-tale symptoms while reading it – it might just equip you with the self-awareness to pause when you find yourself racking up a huge overdraft of idea debt.</p>

<p>Grand plans are all well and good, but you need to make something. You need to <a href="http://tinybooks.github.io/books/" title="Start! Stop Procrastinating and Pursue Your Passion">Start!</a></p>

      <p>Jordan Koschei interviews Ludwig Pettersson, Creative Director at Stripe, for Medium’s ‘In Progress’. There’s a lot to learn in <a href="https://medium.com/in-progress/design-and-collaboration-at-stripe-304626b59312#.9b5oix4ch" title="Design, Process, and Collaboration at Stripe">Koschei’s interview</a>, but one aspect caught my eye in particular, Pettersson’s assertion that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There should be nothing standing in the way of starting a business or selling something online and charging for it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This idea – of levelling the playing field and allowing anyone with an idea for a business to compete with others – lies at the heart of Stripe and other services like it.</p>

<p>Many years ago, when I ran a <a href="http://www.fallt.com" title="Fällt Publishing">record label</a>, managing payments was an expensive business, requiring credit card terminals with costly terms and conditions. Stripe does away with this complexity and, in so doing, paves the way for a host of new, fleet-of-foot businesses to take root.</p>

      <p>I always enjoy Armin Vit and Bryony Gomez-Palacio’s posts at <a href="http://underconsideration.com" title="Under Consideration">Under Consideration</a>. Collectively they cast a critical eye on the wonderful world of graphic design and branding, thoughtfully analysing the identities that cross their paths.</p>

<p>Vit’s analysis of the new brand for <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_vsco_done_in_house.php#.Vr8VFsfHT8t" title="VCSO Rebrand">VCSO</a> is typically exhaustive (exhaustive in a good way) exploring the rationale behind VCSO’s move towards a new, more simplified, marque.</p>

<p>Though VCSO’s marque might appear simple, there’s a great deal of thought behind it, and – while outwardly distilled – if you dig a little deeper there’s a great deal of thought in play.</p>

<p>I’d strongly recommend reading Vit’s analysis, you’ll learn a great deal about how brands work if you do so. At the end of the day, your brand can be distilled down to its essence (in this case a series of circles), what’s important is that you understand what that essence is.</p>

      <p>Say, “Hello!” to <a href="http://www.typography.com/blog/introducing-operator" title="Introducing Operator">Operator</a>, a new monospace typeface (and accompanying monospace-inspired typeface) courtesy of Hoefler &amp; Co.</p>

<p>Designed by Andy Clymer, Operator draws its inspiration from the world of fixed-width fonts whilst eschewing, “the many compromises required of a fixed-width design.”</p>

<p>It’s a lovely typeface – as you’d expect from Hoefler &amp; Co. – and is ideally suited to code environments.</p>

      <p>I’m very much looking forward to speaking at <a href="http://breakingborde.rs/past-events/mental-barriers/" title="Mental Barriers">Breaking Borders</a> on 17 February, 2016. The theme for the evening is ‘Mental Barriers’ and I’ll be talking about confronting some of the challenges I faced trying to get Tiny Books off the ground.</p>

<p>As I put it in the talk description:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this short talk, Christopher Murphy will talk about how he used the deadline for this short talk, to stop procrastinating and actually pursue his passion. If all has gone according to plan, when you hear the talk he’ll share the story of how he turned Tiny Books from an idea, never-delivered, into a reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m making good progress actually delivering on Tiny Books (instead of just talking about it), thanks to this deadline, and I’m looking forward to sharing a few insights I’ve learned along the way.</p>

<p>I’d like to thank <a href="http://mhprompt.org" title="Let’s start a conversation about mental health in technology.">Prompt</a> for supporting the event, enabling me to attend, and share a few thoughts on the important topic of mental health in the technology sector.</p>

      <p>If you’ve ever heard Aaron Draplin speak you’ll know that when he announces a retrospective book of his work contains <a href="http://ddcbook.com" title="Pretty Much Everything">Pretty Much Everything</a>, it contains… pretty much everything (and I can assure you that’s a pretty much everything you’ll eagerly want to explore).</p>

<p>Draplin is an incredibly entertaining communicator. I had the pleasure of organising a venue for him, in 2012, when he spoke in Belfast as a part of <a href="http://2012.buildconf.com" title="Build 2012">Build</a>. (I also enjoyed a late night liason with him in our local McDonalds – sorry – when I bumped into him after hours… we were both famished.)</p>

<p>He’s an inspiring, and entertainingly forthright speaker, with American sized portions of advice to share. I’m very much looking forward to his book.</p>

      <p>With Valentine’s Day just a fortnight away, now’s the time to get your loved one (or, perhaps, yourself?) something sweet.</p>

<p>B&amp;O Play’s beautifully designed products might be at the higher end of the audio spectrum, but that doesn’t mean you can’t learn from their strategies (even if you can only dream of owning some of their lovely products).</p>

<p>For Valentine’s Day, B&amp;O Play offer you the opportunity to <a href="http://www.beoplay.com/landingpages/2016/valentinesday" title="Bundle and Save 50%">Bundle Up for Sweet Savings</a>, offering a considerable saving when you pick a couple of products that they consider a perfect match.</p>

<p>You might not be a purveyor of high end audio products, but ask yourself: How might you combine your offerings for the benefit of your customers? Yes, you’ll lose a little on the transaction, but what you’ll also be doing is providing an incentive to drive some sales.</p>

<p>The result: happy customers, that availed of an opportunity; and a welcome shot in the arm for your cash flow.</p>

      <p>We might all be struggling to reach <a href="http://www.43folders.com/izero" title="Inbox Zero">Inbox Zero</a>, but that doesn’t mean email as a way to share you stories isn’t effective. The key to standing out in a crowded inbox is to put a little effort in and ensure your email is beautiful.</p>

<p>Ever-helpful, the folks at Campaign Monitor have put together a case study showcasing FontShop’s wonderful work in this medium. As they put it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some emails look more like works of art than marketing assets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looking at FontShop’s lovingly designed emails, I’m sure you’d agree.</p>

<p>You might not be a typography aficionado, but I’m sure you’ll appreciate the lengths the FontShop team go to, to ensure that their emails stand out in your overflowing inbox.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/2016/01/how-fontshop-uses-design-bring-beauty-email-marketing/" title="Some emails look more like works of art than marketing assets.">How Fontshop Uses Design to Bring Beauty to Email Marketing</a> is worth reading to gain an insight into how the FontShop team position design at the heart of their email marketing efforts. If nothing else, you might pick up a typographic tip or two along the way. (Which – I hope you’ll agree – is no bad thing.)</p>

      <p>I had the pleasure of speaking at <a href="https://hybridconf.net" title="HybridConf, Berlin">HybridConf, Dublin</a> in 2015, which I very much enjoyed being a part of, so I was delighted to see that the conference is back, once again, for another year in 2016.</p>

<p>This year you can look forward to a new city and a new lineup. So say, “Hello!” to <a href="https://hybridconf.net" title="HybridConf, Berlin">HybridConf, Berlin</a>, which I can safely guarantee will be well worth attending.</p>

<p>As the HybridConf team put it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re the conference for creatives of every kind. We’re the conference that inspires and empowers. We’re the conference that defies conventions. We’re the conference for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you’re free from 18-19 August, 2016, I can think of no better place to be than Berlin. Sign up for announcements to be sure you get a ticket the moment they go on sale.</p>

      <p>I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t tempted by B&amp;O Play’s <a href="http://www.beoplay.com/products/beoplayh7" title="H7">Beoplay H7</a> Cenere Grey headphones: “Premium wireless over-ear headphone with authentic, clear sound performance.” At £329 they’re a little beyond my budget, but that doesn’t mean I can’t aspire.</p>

<p>I had to look up ‘Cenere Grey’. As a designer, with over two decades of experience, it’s not a colour I’d heard of before, but a quick search and I found a multitude of other products available in this – not quite grey – of greys.</p>

<p>(It turns out you can get a Vespa in Cenere Grey, too.)</p>

<p>B&amp;O Play talk about ‘touches of magic’ when they describe the product. What struck me was the use of language as a core part of the product’s description. I can see myself now, trying to persuade Cara – my wife – that these aren’t just headphones, they’re ‘Cenere Grey’ headphones.</p>

<p>I doubt that will fly, but still… one can hope.</p>

      <p>As Dave Winer puts it, in <a href="http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/01/20/0900.html" title="Anywhere but Medium">Anywhere but Medium</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[The] next time you want to post an essay to Medium, do the open web a favour and post it elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anywhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Call me old-fashioned, but I love Weiner’s curmudgeonly tone, and I wholeheartedly agree with his thinking. As he puts it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Medium is on its way to becoming the consensus platform for writing on the web. If you’re not sure you’re going to be blogging regularly, the default place to put your writing is Medium.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The trouble with this approach lies in the fact that, if you’re not careful, you’re driving traffic to Medium (which has its own priorities in play), when perhaps you should be driving that traffic to your own home on the web.</p>

<p>The web is about destinations, underpinned by hyperlinks. Medium has it’s benefits, of course, but nothing beats hosting your own thoughts (essays, if you will) at your own site.</p>

      <p>If you haven’t discovered <a href="http://www.readlagom.com" title="Lagom is a publication about people making a living from their passions, and pastime activities that offer inspiration.">Lagom</a>, I’d encourage you to rectify that now. Lovingly produced by Elliot and Samantha Stocks, it should occupy pride of place on coffee tables the world over (after having been read, of course).</p>

<p>I was delighted to be invited to contribute an article on wild swimming for Issue 3, for the magazine’s <a href="http://blog.readlagom.com/post/137623698253/the-emptiness-of-the-sea-allows-you-space-to" title="Escape and Recharge">Escape and Recharge</a> section.</p>

<p>I believe it’s important to have a space away from the clamour of our ever-present, digitally-accelerated lives – and, for me, that space away is wild swimming – so the article was a welcome opportunity to share that belief, for a need for non-digital space, with others.</p>

<p>Beautifully photographed by <a href="http://danrubin.pixieset.com/lagomissue3/" title="Lagom Issue 3">Dan Rubin</a> – who captured the wilds of the rugged Donegal coastline perfectly – I was delighted with the final result.</p>

<p>Issue 3, like Issues 1 and 2, is a beauty and is <a href="http://www.readlagom.com/shop" title="Get a copy…">available now</a>.</p>

      <p>It’s no secret that I’m a <a href="https://sugru.com" title="Sugru: FIX THAT THING">Sugru</a> supporter. (Sugru is, perhaps unsurprisingly, a case study in my first Tiny Book <a href="http://tinybooks.org/books" title="Start!">Start!</a>)</p>

<p>I’ve always found Sugru’s story inspiring. It’s a story of relentless  – never-give-up – perseverance. It’s also a story that we can all learn from, about the power of staying true to your vision and pursuing that vision to the end.</p>

<p>In 2014, when I launched my Kickstarter for my design conference, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fehler/break-a-conference-that-questions-the-edges-of-des" title="Break: A Conference That Questions the Edges of Design">Break</a>, Sugru founder Jane Ni Dhulchaointigh – I prefer to call her ‘Jane’, as I’ve always struggled with accurate pronunciations – was right at the heart of my speaker wishlist.</p>

<p>I was delighted when she agreed to speak at Break, and her talk – on the highs and lows of her journey – had attendees talking for quite some time afterwards. (It’s no exaggeration to say that she completely moved the audience.)</p>

<p>I was delighted to see that the fine folks at moo.com have an interview with Jane, <a href="https://www.moo.com/blog/2015/10/28/sugrus-jane-ni-dhulchaointigh-on-innovation-and-facing-challenges/" title="On Innovation and Facing Challenges">‘on innovation and facing challenges’</a>. (I’ll admit, I was late finding it.)</p>

<p>I’d wholeheartedly recommend reading Jane’s story. If you’ve ever had a dream, but found the confidence knocked out of you along your journey, Jane has a lot to share with you. As she puts it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Start small and make it good.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that’s great advice. Start small. Make something. Make it the best you can. After that the pieces – generally – fall into place.</p>

      <p>Paul Jarvis bids farewell to Medium. As he puts it, <a href="https://medium.pjrvs.com/it-s-not-you-it-s-me-112760cb2ff4#.9rsdj1f8s" title="It’s not you, it’s me.">It’s not you, it’s me.</a> Jarvis states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve realised that I don’t want to keep playing in other people’s playgrounds. I’d rather focus on and foster my own.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>While you’ve helped me grow my audience (I have more followers here than on Twitter or my own mailing list), growth isn’t my only metric for measuring what I do and how much it supports me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jarvis is just one of a series of writers that, as we ease into a new year, are revisiting the platforms that they embrace (or eschew), rediscovering the spirit of the open web and focusing their efforts on their own plots. (<a href="https://indiewebcamp.com" title="A people-focused alternative to the ‘corporate web’.">Homesteading, not sharecropping.</a>)</p>

<p>Yes, Medium has benefits, and – as Jarvis acknowledges - Medium has helped him grow his audience, however, the quid pro quo is that Jarvis is driving (his) traffic elsewhere. There’s always a trade off.</p>

<p>It’s interesting how many writers (and content gatherers) are following suit. There’s clearly something in the air, and that something is a desire to retake ownership of content, removing it from walled gardens and returning it to the open web.</p>

      <p>Leigh Alexander and Jeff Jarvis weigh up the pros and cons for Twitter’s mooted move from 140 to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/05/why-twitter-is-right-to-expand-to-10000-characters" title="10,000 characters…">10,000</a> characters:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would a new character limit be good news for open debate on Twitter – or would the end of brevity just be an excuse for more ads?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The case for in 10,000 characters; the case against in 140 characters. A lovely little bit of attention to detail.</p>

<p>Sold in Middle Eastern countries for the month of Ramadan, as part of Coca-Cola’s ongoing world peace-themed campaign, it’s instantly recognisable sans script. Lovely.</p>

      <p>Throughout 2015 I had the pleasure of writing a monthly column for <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net" title="The Pastry Box">The Pastry Box</a>, a shared resource that afforded the opportunity to learn from creatives the world over. As Alex Duloz, The Pastry Box’s founder, put it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The concept of the Pastry Box is quite simple: bring people together and let them write about anything they want. If you do that, you should get some kind of testimony about our day and age.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reading others’ thoughts on The Pastry Box over the last few years inspired me tremendously, and I was honoured to be invited to contribute to the project. My focus was on creativity, focusing on a monthly programme that readers could follow to grow creatively.</p>

<p>For four – inspiring – years, Alex Duloz and Katy Watkins (the project’s editor) invited a handful of ‘bakers’, “To share thoughts regarding what they do.”</p>

<p>Their intention was to publish a daily dose of inspiration from makers around the world. I’m delighted to have been a part of the project, and – one day – imagine some of my content for The Pastry Box will find its way into my Tiny Books. Until then, you can read my thoughts on <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/baker/christopher-murphy" title="Designing a Mind">Designing a Mind</a> at The Pastry Box archive.</p>

<p>I’ll miss The Pastry Box, but it lives on in an archive of published material. It contains a wealth of thoughts and certainly constitutes a testimony about our day and age.</p>

      <p>It’s been a time-honoured tradition of mine to launch any new journal with a short ‘Hello, World!’ post. Given that the Tiny Books site is built using GitHub Pages and Jekyll, it seemed appropriate to link to the ‘Hello, World!’ page at GitHub Guides to get the ball rolling.</p>
